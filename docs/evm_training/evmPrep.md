* Node 16.13+
* Python
* Yarn
* [Ubuntu Linux 20.04](https://ubuntu.com) (Desktop or Server edition)
* [MacOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/) (Big Sur 11.0+)

> Note: Throughout most of our demos and walkthroughs, Ubuntu Linux 20.04 is used. This is the preferred platform by most developers.

> The default version of Node.js included with Ubuntu 20.04 is v10.19.0, and this is not sufficient.

> For these tasks, version 16.13.x is needed. Versions lower than this may not work.
